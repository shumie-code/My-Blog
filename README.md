# My-Blog
This blog application is a project app that is rendered in react js.
The application has a mongoDB backend that stores previously 
collected blog post and comments.
The blog is to be hosted in a Docker Container, which will then be deployed online to be 
hosted by either AWS OR HEROKU.

As of this moment it is still  a work in progress.
